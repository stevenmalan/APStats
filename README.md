Students are often told
- When to use $t$-distributions
- How to draw them
- How to find $p$-values in a calculator

...but they are seldom visually shown where they come from.

This lesson will give a gut-feeling understanding of why variability increases when we used sample standard deviation when standardizing $\bar{x}$.
