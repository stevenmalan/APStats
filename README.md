# WhyT
### Showing students _why_ we neet t-distributions

Students are often told
- When to use t-distributions
- How to draw them
- How to find p-values in a calculator

...but they are seldom visually shown where they come from.

This lesson will give a gut-feeling understanding of why variability increases when we used sample standard deviation when standardizing x-bar.
